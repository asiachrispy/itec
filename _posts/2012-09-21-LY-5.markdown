### Part Three
####  肯尼迪演讲
In the long history, only a few generation has been granted the role of defending freedom in it's hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility --- I welcome it.

I do not believe that any of us would exchange the places with any other people or any other generation. The energey,  the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who server it. And the glow from that fire can truely light the world.   

`And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, but ask you can do your country.`   

`My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what American will do for you, but  what togother we can do for the freedom of man. `

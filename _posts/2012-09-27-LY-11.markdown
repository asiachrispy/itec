####如何负责 How  to Take Responsibility
 ```
    Ladies and gentelemen, tonight I want to talk about taking responsibility. It's always hard to admit something is your fault. In fact, people rarely say "It's my fault. " People alway make execuses or say somebody else's fault. It's hard to solve problems because people like to blame others. The next time you make a mistake, take responsibility! Four little words can make a big diffrence. Try saying, "It's my fault."  
 ```

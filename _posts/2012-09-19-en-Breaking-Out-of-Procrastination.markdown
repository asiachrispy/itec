Hey!   

One of the most common things people email me about is maybe not so
surprisingly procrastination.

They want to get started but get lost on Facebook or in less important tasks.

I'm sure we have all been there. But what can you do about it?

Well, today I would like to share the solution I use most often. The solution that
has probably been most effective for me to break out procrastination over the
past two years or so.

That solution is to reduce the pressure and expectations as much as possible.

Because if you see a big task or project or just the daunting pile of dishes in front of
you then that causes some kind of pain or resistance inside of you. So you shy
away from doing it and go do something that feels better instead like playing
video games or checking the email for the fifth time before lunch.

So here's what I do:

- I tell myself that I only have to work for 2 minutes on this task today. Then
I can continue another day.
- If that still doesn't get me going I just ask myself for 1 minute of work. And I
can do it that one minute of work in a very relaxed pace if I want.
When I only have to make such a minimal effort it doesn't feel big or hard or
uncomfortable anymore. It may not feel like fun either. Usually, it just is and I do
that minute or two of work.

After that I almost never just quit. Instead, I often tell myself: "OK, those
minutes weren't so bad really". And so I continue for half an hour or more.

Or I may ignite a small spark of enthusiasm or kick-start a little bit of forward
momentum. And so a whole lot of work usually gets done.

Make the start as easy and light as you can. Be kind to yourself in this way and
you'll be amazed at how much you can get started and done with that you have
been procrastinating on for quite some time.

Until next time, have a wonderful couple of days!

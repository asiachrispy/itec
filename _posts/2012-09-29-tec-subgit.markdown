##SubGit 1.0: "stress-free" Subversion to Git migration

SubGit provides bidirectional Subversion to Git replication   Source: [SubGit](http://www.h-online.com/developer/news/item/SubGit-1-0-stress-free-Subversion-to-Git-migration-1717931.html)

Moving from one source code control system to another can be a stressful process; more so if you have to keep them synchronised. The developers at TMate Software believe they can reduce that stress for Subversion and Git users with the release of version 1.0 of SubGit. The tool provides bi-directional migration between the Apache Subversion (svn) and Git revision control and source code systems. Written in Java, SubGit runs server-side, requiring access to both Subversion and Git repositories over the local filesystem; this means that individual developers don't need to learn anything new or install additional tools on each client system.
According to its developers at TMate Software, SubGit was built as an alternative to Git-Svn and provides for "a smooth, stress-free Svn to Git migration". It requires no changes to existing infrastructure, allowing all of the features of both Git and Subversion to be used. SubGit's creators note that, compared to Git-Svn, with SubGit "nothing is lost in translation" and that developers can use Git and any tools they want, where as Git-Svn is command-line only.
More details about the tool can be found in the SubGit Book and provided documentation. SubGit 1.0 requires Java 1.5 or later, and can be downloaded from the project's site as a universal zip archive for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, along with a package for Debian and Ubuntu. A free registration key is available that allows for up to 10 repositories with up to 10 committers; open source projects can apply for a free key. Prices for commercial use start at â‚¬1,600. TMate Software also develops SVNKit, a pure Java Subversion Library.

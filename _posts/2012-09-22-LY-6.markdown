### Part Two 
#### My first trip to America
```
  Ladies and gentleman, I just got back from America yesterday. 
  This is my first visit to America. I'd like to say a few words about my first trip. 
  Everything was new and fresh. I got up early to exercise in the park.
   I visited many interesting places. I met a lot of interesting people. 
   I felt a little nervous, but I still talked to people. 
   They were very friendly and helpful. 
   I had a great first impression of the American people.

### Part Three
####  克林顿演讲

    To renew America, we must be bold. 
    `We must do that no generation has had to do befor.` 
    We must inverst more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, 
    and at the same time cut our massive debt. 
    And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.
    It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done and done fairly, 
    not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake.     
    We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.

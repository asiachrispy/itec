Last day I visited facebook.comï¼Œgot a wanderful picture with some sentences, which had deeply touched me. I think you all like the picture and the  sentences.

##*Life Is An Echo*

> What you send ~ Will Come Back.   
    What you sow ~ you Will Reap.    
    What you give ~ you Will Get.   
    What you see in Others ~ Exists In You.     
    ---   
    So try not to judge, even those who will judge you.    
    Give out all the love you can and let your love shine through.

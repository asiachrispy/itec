**It isn't hard to be good from time to time.**
**What's tough is being good every day.**    
**偶尔做的好并不难，难的是每天做的好。**

这句话有让我想起毛泽东同志那句话：`“做一次好事并不难，难得是做一生的好事。”`，这句话是在鼓励大家应该向雷锋同志学习他那种助人为乐的精神。

####*A Good Book Is Like A Good Friend*
```
Ladies and Gentlemen, today I'd like to talk about books. A good book is like a good friend. You should read as many books as you possbily can. You should not just take a quick look at a book. You should read it carefully, again and again. There si a famous quote, *"A man who doesn't rad books is far worse off than a man who can't read books"*. Make books your friends and let books take you around the world. Get a book now and dive into it. Let the wisdom cantained in the books guide you through your life.
```

####每天六个一值二
##### *做一番运动*
每天运动30到45分钟，免疫细胞数目会增加，抵抗力也会相对增加。不过，运动太激烈会时间超过1小时，身体反而会制造一些荷尔蒙，抑制免疫系统的活动。

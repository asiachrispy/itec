### Part Two 
#### Chinese and English

	Ladies and Gentleman, today I want to talk about the difference 
	between English and Chinese.The English is very difference Chinese,
	the sounds are different.The grammar is different,and writting is totally different.
	It's very difficult to learn English well.It is even more difficult to speak 
	English fluently.
	  If you want to speak English well, you must forget about the differences.
	Just practice correct sentences and passages until you're used to them.
	The more things you can blut out,the better you can express yourselves.
	If you believe in yourself and practice crazily every day,you will make it.
	You will canquer English.Chinese is the most difficult language in the world.
	If you can speak Chinese,you can speak English,it is up to you.
	I think you can make it.

### Part Three

	冷热浴，既除疲劳又强身。运动完毕，休息半个小时，先冷水（15度）沐浴一分钟，然后热水沐浴两分钟，
	交替三次，神清气爽。
